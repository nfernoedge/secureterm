Secureterm is designed to generate random returns of an adjective, a noun, and 3 numbers. There are lots of use cases for this such as generating semi-strong passwords for password hash practice.

# Usage
## With secureterm.py
python secureterm.py [-n N]

-n N will return N results, the script will return one result by default

## With secureterm.ps1
.\Script.ps1 [-numResults N]

-numResults N will return N results, the script will return one result by default.
